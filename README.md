# Reinforcement_Learning_1

This is a review Yuxi Liu's Book PyTorch 1.x Reinforcemenet Learning Cookbook by Packt Publishing. I commented every single algorithm and replicated the results.
The best way to approach this repository is to do it in order. I attach a requirements.txt file so the versions of the packages I used are clear. Thanks!
